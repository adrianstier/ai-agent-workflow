# Project: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]

## Orchestrator-Driven Mode

This project uses the AI Agent Workflow system in **Orchestrator-Driven Mode**. Agent 0 (Orchestrator) drives the entire development process, selecting the right agent for each task and only asking key questions when decisions are needed.

### How This Works

1. **Start each session** by telling Claude about your project and what you want to work on
2. **Agent 0 automatically** assesses project state, identifies the next task, and selects the right agent
3. **You only get asked** when there are key decisions, ambiguous requirements, or tradeoffs to consider
4. **Artifacts are saved** to `artifacts/` as each phase completes
5. **The orchestrator returns** after each task to plan the next step

### When to Interrupt Me (Human Input Needed)

- Key product decisions (scope, features, priorities)
- Technical choices with significant tradeoffs
- Ambiguous requirements needing clarification
- Before any destructive operations
- Go/No-Go decisions at validation gates

### When NOT to Interrupt Me

- Routine implementation details
- Standard best practices
- File organization decisions
- Formatting and style choices

## Project Context

### Overview
- **Name**: [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
- **One-liner**: [Brief description]
- **Target Users**: [Who is this for?]

### Constraints
- **Timeline**: [X weeks to v0.1]
- **Budget**: [$X/month max]
- **Tech Preferences**: [Languages, frameworks, etc.]
- **Hard Requirements**: [Non-negotiable constraints]

## Agent Reference

The orchestrator has access to 20+ specialized agents:

**Core Development (0-9)**: Orchestrator, Problem Framer, Competitive Mapper, Product Manager, UX Designer, System Architect, Engineer, QA Test Engineer, DevOps, Analytics

**Debug Suite (10-16)**: Debug Detective, Visual Debug, Performance Profiler, Network Inspector, State Debugger, Error Tracker, Memory Leak Hunter

**Review (17-20)**: Security Auditor, Code Reviewer, Database Engineer, Design Reviewer

Agent prompts are located in: `[PATH_TO_AGENTS]/agents/`

## Current State

### Phase
- [ ] Discovery (Agents 1-2)
- [ ] Definition (Agents 3-5)
- [ ] Implementation (Agents 6-7)
- [ ] Launch (Agents 8-9)
- [ ] Iteration

### Completed Artifacts
<!-- Update as artifacts are completed -->
- [ ] problem-brief-v0.1.md
- [ ] competitive-analysis-v0.1.md
- [ ] prd-v0.1.md
- [ ] ux-flows-v0.1.md
- [ ] architecture-v0.1.md
- [ ] test-plan-v0.1.md
- [ ] deployment-plan-v0.1.md
- [ ] analytics-plan-v0.1.md

### Current Focus
[What you're currently working on]

### Decisions Made
<!-- Record key decisions to maintain context -->
- [Decision 1]
- [Decision 2]

## Session Start

When I start a session, Claude should:

1. Read this file and understand the project context
2. Check artifact status in `artifacts/`
3. Assess which validation gate we're at
4. Recommend the next action using Agent 0's decision framework
5. Execute the appropriate agent's methodology
6. Save outputs to the correct artifact file
7. Return to orchestration for the next task

## Flow Control

I can adjust the workflow at any time:

- **"Speed up"** - Make assumptions, ask fewer questions, move faster
- **"Slow down"** - Be more thorough, validate assumptions, explain more
- **"Skip [agent]"** - Skip an agent (with risk acknowledgment)
- **"Go back to [phase]"** - Revisit an earlier phase
- **"Just do [X]"** - Execute a specific task without orchestration
- **"Pause"** - Stop and summarize current state

## Quality Standards

- PRD must have 5-8 MUST features maximum (no scope creep)
- Architecture must use "boring" proven technology
- All MUST features need testable acceptance criteria
- Validation gates must pass before phase transitions
